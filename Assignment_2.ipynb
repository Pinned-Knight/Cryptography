    "# Assignment 2: Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EC-DSA)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analyzing TLS Certificate Elliptic Curve Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 1: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Digital Signatures?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Digital signatures** are cryptographic mechanisms that provide:\n",
    "- **Authentication**: Verification that a message comes from the claimed sender\n",
    "- **Integrity**: Assurance that the message has not been altered\n",
    "- **Non-repudiation**: The sender cannot deny having sent the message\n",
    "\n",
    "They are the digital equivalent of handwritten signatures but offer much stronger security guarantees through mathematical foundations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is EC-DSA?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EC-DSA)** is a variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) that uses **elliptic curve cryptography** instead of traditional integer factorization or discrete logarithm problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of EC-DSA:**\n",
    "- **Smaller key sizes**: A 256-bit EC key provides comparable security to a 3072-bit RSA key\n",
    "- **Faster computations**: Shorter keys mean faster signing and verification\n",
    "- **Lower bandwidth**: Smaller signatures reduce data transmission overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role in TLS/HTTPS\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**, EC-DSA is used to:\n",
    "1. **Authenticate the server** to the client during the handshake\n",
    "2. **Sign the key exchange parameters** to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks\n",
    "3. **Establish trust** through certificate chains\n",
    "\n",
    "When you visit a website over HTTPS, the server presents a **TLS certificate** containing its public key. If the certificate uses EC-DSA, the public key is a point on an elliptic curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will:\n",
    "1. Load and parse a real TLS certificate from `_.bits-pilani.ac.in`\n",
    "2. Extract elliptic curve information from the certificate\n",
    "3. Identify the finite field used\n",
    "4. Understand what information is directly available vs. what requires external standards\n",
    "5. Recover the complete elliptic curve equation using NIST/SEC specifications"

    "## Section 2: Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Question\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Given a website TLS certificate that uses EC-DSA for its public key, can we extract the elliptic curve equation and the characteristic of the finite field?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Question is Non-Trivial\n",
    "\n",
    "This question appears simple at first glance, but it reveals important aspects of how cryptographic standards work in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Certificates don't store curve equations**: For efficiency and standardization, TLS certificates only store a **curve identifier** (like \"secp256r1\"), not the actual mathematical parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Named curves vs. explicit parameters**: The industry uses **named curves** — pre-defined, well-studied curves with known security properties. Storing explicit parameters would be wasteful and could introduce non-standard (potentially weak) curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Separation of concerns**: The certificate tells us *which* curve is used; external standards (NIST, SEC) tell us *what* that curve actually is mathematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trust through standardization**: Using named curves ensures that all parties agree on the exact mathematical definition, preventing subtle implementation differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate that:\n",
    "- The **curve name** can be extracted directly from the certificate\n",
    "- The **curve equation** and **field characteristic** must be looked up from standards\n",
    "- This is by design, not a limitation"

    "## Section 3: Certificate Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Does a TLS Certificate Contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "A TLS certificate (X.509 format) contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Field | Description |\n",
    "|-------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Subject** | Identity of the certificate holder (e.g., domain name) |\n",
    "| **Issuer** | Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the certificate |\n",
    "| **Validity Period** | Start and expiration dates |\n",
    "| **Public Key** | The subject's public key for encryption/verification |\n",
    "| **Signature Algorithm** | Algorithm used by the CA to sign the certificate |\n",
    "| **Extensions** | Additional metadata (key usage, subject alt names, etc.) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public Key Information in Certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "For EC-DSA certificates, the public key section contains:\n",
    "1. **Algorithm identifier**: Indicates this is an EC key (e.g., `id-ecPublicKey`)\n",
    "2. **Named curve OID**: Object Identifier specifying which curve (e.g., `secp256r1`)\n",
    "3. **Public key point**: The actual public key as a point $(Q_x, Q_y)$ on the curve\n",
    "\n",
    "### Named Elliptic Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of storing the full curve equation, certificates use **named curves**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name | Also Known As | Field Size |\n",
    "|------|---------------|------------|\n",
    "| secp256r1 | prime256v1, P-256 | 256 bits |\n",
    "| secp384r1 | P-384 | 384 bits |\n",
    "| secp521r1 | P-521 | 521 bits |\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is NOT Stored in Certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are **NOT** explicitly stored in the certificate:\n",
    "- The prime $p$ (field characteristic)\n",
    "- Curve coefficients $a$ and $b$\n",
    "- Generator point $G$\n",
    "- Order $n$ of the curve\n",
    "\n",
    "These must be obtained from the standard specification (NIST FIPS 186-4 or SEC 2)."

    "### How do we obtain the curve equation?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract the curve name** from the certificate (e.g., `secp256r1`)\n",
    "2. **Look up the parameters** in published standards:\n",
    "   - NIST FIPS 186-4 (Digital Signature Standard)\n",

    "3. **Construct the equation**: $y^2 \\equiv x^3 + ax + b \\pmod{p}$\n",

    "### Why is this design appropriate?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficiency**: Storing just a curve identifier is much smaller than storing all parameters\n",
